# SCRIPT.JS FORMALLY KNOWN AS SBA-MODULE-308-JAVASCRIPT 
*Originally submitted 11:56pm 2024-11-02 -In keeping with Submission Deadlines*
*Corrected Problems/Issues 12:35am 2024-11-03*
## How This Script works 
<P> 
This program processes learner submission data for a course by calculating average scores and filtering out specific assignments. It takes course information details, assignment group details, and learner submissions details as input, checks for late submissions, applies penalties, and accumulates scores. By excluding a specific assignment (ID 3), it computes each learner's average score based on the remaining submissions and presents the results in a structured format that includes learner IDs, average scores, and scores for the included assignments. </P>


## Objectives
• Employ basic JavaScript syntax accurately.
• Implement control flow structures such as conditionals and loops effectively.
• Use arrays and objects to organize and manage data.
• Develop functions to create reusable code.
• Utilize loops and iteration to navigate through data collections.
• Implement error handling to manage potential code failures gracefully.


### Instructions
You will create a script that:
1. Gathers data, 
2. Processes it, and then 
3. Outputs a consistent result as described by a specification. 
This is a very typical situation in industry, and this particular scenario has been modified from a real application. The data you will use is provided below. (Its Code Sandbox).



### Requirement  						                        Weight 

Declare variables properly using let and const where appropriate. 5%

Use operators to perform calculations on variables and literals.  5%

Use strings, numbers, and Boolean values cached within variables. 5%

Use at least two if/else statements to control program flow. Optionally,                                                        10%
use at least one switch statement.

Use try/catch statements to manage potential errors in the code, such as  5%incorrectly formatted or typed data being fed into your program.


Utilize at least two different types of loops. 5%


Utilize at least one loop control keyword such as break or continue. 5%


Create and/or manipulate arrays and objects.				    10%


Demonstrate the retrieval, manipulation, and removal of items in an array or 10%
 properties in an object.


Use functions to handle repeated tasks.					10%


Program outputs processed data as described above. 			20%
Partial credit will be earned depending on the level of adherence 
to the described behavior.

Ensure that the program runs without errors (comment out things 	10%
that do not work, and explain your blockers 
- you can still receive partial credit).


Commit frequently to the git repository.				5%

Include a README file that contains a description of your application.	 2%


## Problem/Issues
The Output: Printing averages and assignments for each id !!!! 
Solved!!!![✓], Re-did the math aspect to get the corresponding output result.
