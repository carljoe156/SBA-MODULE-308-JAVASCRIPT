## Objectives
• Employ basic JavaScript syntax accurately.
• Implement control flow structures such as conditionals and loops effectively.
• Use arrays and objects to organize and manage data.
• Develop functions to create reusable code.
• Utilize loops and iteration to navigate through data collections.
• Implement error handling to manage potential code failures gracefully.


### Instructions

1. Gathers data, 
2. Processes it, and then 
3. Outputs a consistent result as described by a specification. 
This is a very typical situation in industry, and this particular scenario has been modified from a real application. The data you will use is provided below. (Its Code Sandbox).
