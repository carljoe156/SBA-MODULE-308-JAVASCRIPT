# SBA-MODULE-308-JAVASCRIPT RENAMED to SCRIPT.JS
## Objectives
• Employ basic JavaScript syntax accurately.
• Implement control flow structures such as conditionals and loops effectively.
• Use arrays and objects to organize and manage data.
• Develop functions to create reusable code.
• Utilize loops and iteration to navigate through data collections.
• Implement error handling to manage potential code failures gracefully.


### Instructions
You will create a script that:
1. Gathers data, 
2. Processes it, and then 
3. Outputs a consistent result as described by a specification. 
This is a very typical situation in industry, and this particular scenario has been modified from a real application. The data you will use is provided below. (Its Code Sandbox).



Requirement  						                        	Weight 

Declare variables properly using let and const where appropriate. 5%

Use operators to perform calculations on variables and literals.  5%

Use strings, numbers, and Boolean values cached within variables. 5%

Use at least two if/else statements to control program flow. Optionally,                                                        10%
use at least one switch statement.

Use try/catch statements to manage potential errors in the code, such as  5%incorrectly formatted or typed data being fed into your program.


Utilize at least two different types of loops. 5%


Utilize at least one loop control keyword such as break or continue. 5%


Create and/or manipulate arrays and objects.				    10%


Demonstrate the retrieval, manipulation, and removal of items in an array or 10%
 properties in an object.


Use functions to handle repeated tasks.					10%


Program outputs processed data as described above. 			20%
Partial credit will be earned depending on the level of adherence 
to the described behavior.

Ensure that the program runs without errors (comment out things 	10%
that do not work, and explain your blockers 
- you can still receive partial credit).


Commit frequently to the git repository.				5%

Include a README file that contains a description of your application.	 2%
